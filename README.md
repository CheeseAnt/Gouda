Personal projects

Mainly things that interest me but might be of use to someone else. If I think that might happen, I'll comment about them here.


## Snek

An overnight project that I took on with my roommate in an effort to learn python. We did okay. I like it, anyway.

```
cd Gouda/Python
python snake.py
```

Then follow instructions on screen.
NOTE: '2' does not mean the number 2. It means 'to'. Use wasd/arrow keys to play. P to pause/resume.

Also, haha, python, snake
