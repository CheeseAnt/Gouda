Personal projects

Mainly things that interest me but might be of use to someone else. If I think that might happen, I'll comment about them here.


## Snek

An overnight project that I took on with my roommate in an effort to learn python. We did okay. I like it, anyway.

```
cd Gouda/Python
python snake.py
```

Then follow instructions on screen.
NOTE: '2' does not mean the number 2. It means 'to'. Use wasd/arrow keys to play. P to pause/resume.

Also, haha, python, snake

## BackroundYoutube

yes I know I missed the g, not the first time

A badly written android app that will successfully allow you to play a single video in the background, before you have to do it again.

### directions to use
install app
go to youtube app
find video
click "share" button on video
share to backroundyoutube
it will begin playing in the background, can exit app/whatever.

also has badly working notification controls.
sometimes need to reset, just close app forcibly and reopen
